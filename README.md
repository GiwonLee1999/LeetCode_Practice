# LeetCode Progress and Revision

## Introduction

I have embarked on a journey to enhance my problem-solving skills by tackling various coding challenges on LeetCode. As of now, I have successfully solved **100s questions** in the past. This document serves as a record of my progress and outlines my strategy for revision and further improvement.

## Revision Strategy

To solidify my understanding and ensure long-term retention of the concepts, I am implementing the following revision plan:

### 1. Categorization and Tagging

I have categorized the questions based on their tags such as Array, String, Dynamic Programming, etc. This helps in focusing on specific areas that need improvement. See the **Reference**.

### 2. Revisiting Incorrect Solutions

I will revisit the problems I initially solved incorrectly or struggled with. This involves:

- Reviewing the problem statement and constraints.
- Analyzing my previous approach and identifying mistakes.
- Studying optimal solutions and understanding different approaches.

### 3. Practice Regularly

Consistent practice is key to mastery. I have scheduled regular practice sessions where I will:

- Re-solve previously solved questions without referring to past solutions.
- Attempt new questions within the same category to reinforce concepts.

### 4. Leveraging Resources

Utilizing various resources such as:

- **LeetCode Discuss**: Engaging with the community to gain insights and alternative solutions.
- **Editorials and Tutorials**: Reading through detailed explanations and watching video tutorials for complex problems.

### 5. Tracking Progress

I will keep track of my revision progress by maintaining a spreadsheet that logs:

- Date of revision.
- Questions reviewed.
- Notes and observations.
- Areas of improvement.

## Goals

- **Short-Term**: Solve 150 questions by the end of the next quarter.
- **Long-Term**: Achieve a deeper understanding of core algorithms and data structures, and enhance my coding efficiency and problem-solving speed.

## Conclusion

By following this structured revision plan, I aim to strengthen my foundational knowledge and become more proficient in tackling a wide range of coding challenges. Continuous learning and persistent practice are the cornerstones of my journey towards excellence in competitive programming.
